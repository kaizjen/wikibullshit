# Wikibullshit
Stolen from [Two of these people are lying](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfx61sxf1Yz2I-c7eMRk9wBUUDCJkU7H0) by Technical Difficulties, this is a multiplayer party game about lies, deception and Wikipedia articles.

It's available publicly at [wikibullshit.vercel.app](https://wikibullshit.vercel.app), so you can play it too!

The game is simple: there's a host, and the players. Before each round, each of the players picks a Wikipedia article, memorizes it just well enough and inputs its title\* into the website.  
After everyone is ready, the host clicks the Big Blue Buttonâ„¢ and the game picks one of these article titles at random, say "[Feast of the Ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Ass)".  
Now, one player knows what the article says. All other players have to quickly make something up that *could* be in an article with that title and convince the host that *they're* the truthteller.  
The host has to guess which player is telling the truth.

\* The rules are obviously whatever you agree they are, but there are some useful restrictions to have:
1. Firstly, no lists because that's just boring and dumb.
1. Secondly, players shouldn't put the article's name verbatim - they should remove all the text in parenthesis and maybe input only the name, like "Meager massif" instead of "[Mount Meager massif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meager_massif)", or only the surname, like "Strange" instead of "[Guy Le Strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Le_Strange)" (ok no the other one's funnier). If they're feeling spicy, they can even use one of the aliases written in the body of the article, for example, you can write "Dictionary" instead of "[Associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array)", even though this word is in the synonyms and not technically in the title (the synonym still has to be mentioned by the article).
1. Thirdly, pick something interesting and not well-known. Try to pick something a little bit too obscure for the host and the other players. Keeps the game fun!
1. And for the host: give the liars a little bit of leeway. A good way of doing it would be to, as soon as the article title is revealed, ask each player about a very quick description of whatever they're talking about, like "A medieval celebration", and after everyone has answered, go around again and ask for more details on each of their articles.
1. Also, be nice and have fun! Don't accuse other players of lying, or the game will get tiresome real quick. Instead, try to engage a little with whatever `Wikibullshit` they're spewing.
1. oh and don't cheat. you can't just open up ur article and read it out loud. or google the selected article. like bro.
